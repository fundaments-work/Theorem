A **free, open-source, local-first** reading app that runs on **Linux, macOS, Windows, and Android** from a shared codebase. Read PDFs, EPUBs, MOBI, FB2, CBZ, CBR, and RSS feeds — all in one workspace. Highlight and annotate with six colors. Look up words with offline dictionaries. Listen with neural text-to-speech. Share highlights as beautiful images. Sync everything to Markdown files in your Obsidian or Logseq vault.

**No cloud account. No subscription wall. No vendor lock-in.**

## Why Theorem?

Built for **knowledge workers** who want to own their reading data:

- **Your data stays local** — everything on your device. No cloud, no tracking, no data mining.
- **Portable by design** — exports are plain Markdown files. Move to any tool anytime.
- **True offline-first** — works completely without internet. Sync when you choose.
- **No subscriptions** — free and open-source. Always.

### Is Theorem a Readwise alternative?

Yes. Local-first reading, annotation, and Markdown export without a paid subscription. Plus: ebook reader, RSS reader, vocabulary builder, neural TTS, LAN sync, and highlight sharing — all in one app.

## FAQ

**Is my data safe?** — Yes. Everything is stored locally. No cloud account required.

**Can I migrate away?** — Yes. Exports are plain Markdown files, portable to any tool.

**Does it work with Obsidian and Logseq?** — Yes. Markdown sync is designed for vault-based workflows.

**Is there device sync?** — Yes. Encrypted LAN pairing between Theorem installs, no cloud relay.

**Does TTS work offline?** — Yes. It uses your system's built-in TTS engine. No downloads needed.

**What formats are supported?** — EPUB, MOBI, AZW, AZW3, FB2, FBZ, CBZ, CBR, PDF, TXT, and RSS feeds.

**Can I try it without installing?** — Yes. The [web demo](https://app.theorem.fundaments.work) runs in your browser.

**Why MIT instead of AGPL?** — MIT lets anyone use, modify, and integrate the code without forcing them to open-source their changes. For a local-first reading app that stores all data as plain Markdown, the protection AGPL offers is unnecessary — your data is already portable.
